# Prostate Cancer Detection

<p style="text-align:justify;">
            Prostate cancer is a cancer that develops in the Prostate Gland, which controls the flow of urine or semen from the reproductive organ of the male reproductive system. <br> 
                <br>
                This system can predict between the two types of Prostate cancer (Benign = B, Malignant = M), all you need do is to supply the required information. <br>
